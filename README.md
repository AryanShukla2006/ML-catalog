# üìò PRML Study Notes ‚Äì Christopher M. Bishop

This repository contains my personal learning notes and summaries as I study the book **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"** by *Christopher M. Bishop*. The aim is to document key concepts, mathematical foundations, and reflections on each topic for future reference and sharing with fellow learners.
