# üìò PRML Study Notes ‚Äì Christopher M. Bishop

This repository contains my personal learning notes and summaries as I study the book **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"** by *Christopher M. Bishop*. The aim is to document key concepts, mathematical foundations, and reflections on each topic for future reference and sharing with fellow learners.

## üìÖ Study Log

### ‚úÖ Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning & Polynomial Curve Fitting
- Applications of Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
- Polynomial curve fitting as a way to demonstrate basic regression
- **Core Concepts Covered:**
  - Generalization
  - Overfitting
  - Polynomial functions as models
  - Cost function: Sum-of-squares error
  - Root Mean Square Error (Erms)
 
### ‚úÖ Day 2: Probability Theory & Bayes' Theorem
- Derivation of **sum and product rules** using probability axioms
- **Bayes' Theorem** for conditional probability, including matrix-based understanding
- Introduction to **Probability Density Functions (PDFs)**
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Importance of marginal, joint, and conditional probability
  - Visualizing dependencies with matrix representations
  - Understanding the shift from discrete to continuous probability using densities


### ‚úÖ Day 3: Continuous Distributions & Bayesian View
- Change of variable and Jacobian in probability densities
- Expectation, variance, and covariance as statistical summaries
- Introduction to Bayesian probability: prior, likelihood, posterior
- Normal (Gaussian) distribution and its importance

### ‚úÖ Day 4: Probabilistic Curve Fitting & MLE vs MAP
- Reformulated polynomial curve fitting as a probabilistic model using Gaussian noise
- Learned Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) via log-likelihood derivation
- Identified MLE's limitations (overfitting, no regularization)
- Introduced Bayesian reasoning with priors ‚Üí Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation
- Hyperparameters like Œ± (prior precision) and Œ≤ (noise precision) introduced for better generalization
